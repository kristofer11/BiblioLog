# BiblioLog - A Book Logging Web App

BiblioLog is a web application developed using React, Redux, SCSS, Express, Mongoose, and MongoDB. It allows users to create an account, build their book library, rate books from 0 to 5, and write reviews. The integrated Google Books API simplifies book discovery and addition to your library.

## Introduction

BiblioLog is the front-end of a project aimed at book enthusiasts. It provides users with a platform to create and manage their personal book libraries, complete with ratings and reviews. The seamless integration with the Google Books API makes book discovery a breeze. As part of our future plans, we're working on features such as the ability to modify ratings and reviews, automatic social media post generation, and connecting with friends to explore their book collections.

üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I present to you the first iteration of BiblioLog, a web app that allows users to track the books they read and store their ratings and reviews. I used React, Redux, SCSS, Express, Mongoose, and MongoDB.

üë®‚Äçüíª The project started as a way to improve my Redux skills and transition from using hooks to Redux for state management, presenting an exciting challenge.

üìö One of my favorite features is the search bar that allows users to find the book they want to add. They can type the author or title and are presented with a list of books with title, author, and an image of the front cover, fetched from Google's Books API. Once they've made their selection, the title, author, rating, review, and image URL are saved to the MongoDB database.

üèã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è While the primary goal was to gain experience with Express and Redux, there are plans to expand the project's social aspect, allowing users to see what their friends are reading and easily share their reviews on social media.

I would greatly appreciate your feedback and suggestions if you decide to check it out!
