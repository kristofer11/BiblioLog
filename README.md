This project was completed as part of The Odin Project. 

The YouTube channel "Web Dev Simplified" was very helpful as I built the modal with vanilla JavaScript.

NEXT STEPS:
---DONE --- 1. INSTEAD OF THE FORM ALWAYS BEING ON THE top, MAKE IT A BUTTON THAT BRINGS UP A MODAL CONTAINING THE FORM.
---DONE --- 2. ADD THE ABILITY TO CHANGE THE READ STATUS OF EACH Book.
3. STYLING: MAKE IT SNAZZY...BOOTSTRAP?
4. FIGURE OUT LOCAL Storage. FIND THE VIDEO USED LAST TIME IF NEEDED ( KEEP READING THROUGH THE ODIN PROJECT AND COMPLETE THIS STEP AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME)
